If you have your own key pair and would like to create a key file the format is as follows:
-------------------------
publickey modulus
privatekey modulus
-------------------------
example:
-------------------------
38307433509 42463068511
37838139917 42463068511

NOTE: If you just want to encrypt, or just want to decrypt, you can put any random number in the publickey or privatekey spot,
respectively. However, a number must be present in said spot for this program to work.
